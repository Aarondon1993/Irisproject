An Iris data set was obtained from the following link: http://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Fisher.html

## Origins of the Iris data set
The iris data set also know as the Fischer data set was compiled by Ronald Fischer in the 1930's. This data set is a complilation of diffrent sepal and petal lengths and widths of various types of iris flowers. This dataset is widely used by the computer science community as an introduction to data analysis and/or machine learning. The data was first published in the scientific journal 'Annals of human genetics'in the year 1936. Fischer titiled his paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'. Fischer took 50 samples of three particular particular spieces of flower, Iris setosa, I. versicolor and Iris virginica. Both Iris setosa and I. versicolor were found to be living in the same colony and the data obatined for these two particular species were provided to Fischer by Dr E.Anderson.[1]

## A brief background on Python.
The programming language Python [2] can be used to analyse datasets of this type very efficiently. Python is a high level programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum from the Netherlands. Van Rossum soth to develope a language that was placed in between the computer langauges C and shell scripts. He wanted a language that 'felt more like a genuine programming langauge like C but was interpreted easier to use like a shell script without the terrible properties in terms of readability like shell scripts'[3]. After over a year of work van Rossum released his new language as open source. This allowed developers to work on the language and further develope it. Guido van Rossum however held the title of BDFL. This meant that van Rossum had the final say in what was contributed to the language by the developers. BDFL means 'Benevolent dictator for life' [4] and is a term that originated from the Python creator. Van Rossum has since resigned this role. Python is an interpreted language. This means that it is not coverted to machinie code until the actual python program is run. Python has a vast amount of applications. Some of these are web development, computer games, web apps and many more.
