An Iris data set was obtained from the following link: http://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Fisher.html

## Origins of the Iris data set
The iris data set also know as the Fischer data set was compiled by Ronald Fischer in the 1930's. This data set is a complilation of diffrent sepal and petal lengths and widths of various types of iris flowers. This dataset is widely used by the computer science community as an introduction to data analysis and/or machine learning. The data was first published in the scientific journal 'Annals of human genetics'in the year 1936. Fischer titiled his paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems'. Fischer took 50 samples of three particular particular spieces of flower, Iris setosa, I. versicolor and Iris virginica. Both Iris setosa and I. versicolor were found to be living in the same colony and the data obatined for these two particular species were provided to Fischer by Dr E.Anderson.
