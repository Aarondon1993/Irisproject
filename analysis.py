import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# The above libraries will be used to read the data in the .csv file, summarise the variables
# and then produce both the histograms and scatter plots.

df = pd.read_csv("IrisDataset.csv")
# Using the .read_csv function of pandas the dataset can be read.
desc= df.groupby('species').describe()

# in order to generate a summary of the dataset contents the df.describe funtion is used.
f = open ('datasetsummary.txt','w')
# The variable 'f' is used to open the destination txt file in write mode.
# Using write mode 'w' this will ensure that the code will overwrite the contents
# of the .txt file each time to keep it tidy. 

f.write (desc.to_string())
# The df.describe must be converted into a string in order for the write funtion to work.
